# Synthetic Sensor Data Generation Framework

## Summary

Field datasets rarely include ground-truth labels for sensor errors, making it difficult to systematically develop and validate methods for anomaly detection, data quality control, and sensor diagnostics. 

This package provides an **R Shiny–based framework** for generating **synthetic time series from two correlated or redundant sensors**, with **user-configurable background signals** and **injected anomalies** (spikes, drifts, delay/attenuation, noise, and bias). The output includes both **anomaly labels** and **true error magnitudes**, enabling quantitative evaluation of diagnostic algorithms. 

The framework supports both interactive use through a Shiny app and programmatic use through R functions, making it useful for researchers and practitioners in sensor-driven domains. Its main goal is to facilitate **reproducible benchmarking** of sensor data quality assessment techniques in situations where controlled evaluation datasets are otherwise scarce.


## Statement of need
While real-world sensor datasets are valuable, they rarely include complete ground-truth labels for error types and magnitudes. This limits the ability to systematically evaluate diagnostic algorithms. 
<!-- To our knowledge, no existing R package offers synthetic generation of multi-sensor time series with flexible anomaly injection and labeled outputs. -->

This software addresses these gaps by:
- Allowing **two sensors** to measure either the same or correlated background signals.
- Providing a **broad set of configurable anomaly types**: spikes, drifts, sensor delay/attenuation, noise, and constant bias.
- Enabling **precise control over anomaly magnitude, duration, and correlation** between sensors.
- Outputting **CSV files with labeled anomalies** for use in supervised learning and method validation.
- Offering an **interactive Shiny UI** for rapid experimentation, as well as scriptable functions for batch generation.

## Related work
Several tools provide synthetic time-series data or anomaly-related functionality, but to our knownledge none combine **multi-sensor redundancy**, **configurable anomaly injection**, and **ground-truth error magnitudes**. Table 1 summarizes the most relevant approaches.

## Use
The framework has been adopted in several research projects. It was used in (Skålvik, 2025) to generate controlled datasets for validating a Bayesian method for error and uncertainty estimation of environmental sensor data. In (Heggedal, 2025), it was applied in the development of a software tool that assists experts with annotating marine time series. It is also planned for use in (Stuen, 202X) for [short description of project].

Beyond these projects, the package is broadly useful for:
- **Reproducible benchmarking**: researchers can share identical datasets (using fixed seeds) to compare diagnostic methods.
- **Teaching and training**: students can experiment with sensor error effects without requiring access to field instruments.
- **Rapid prototyping**: practitioners can quickly simulate “what if” scenarios for sensor anomalies before deploying to the field.


## Implementation
The framework is implemented in **R** and is provided both as:
1. A **Shiny application** for interactive configuration and dataset export.
2. A set of **modular R functions** for programmatic dataset generation.

### Background signal
The package provides functions to generate several background signal models:
- **Autoregressive process (AR(1))** — for stationary signals with tunable autocorrelation.
- **Random walk** — a special case of AR(1) with strong temporal autocorrelation.
- **Poisson moving average** — for smoothed stochastic signals.
- **Sine wave** — for periodic variation.

For the AR(1) and Random walk, the background signals can be **correlated** between sensors with user-defined cross-correlation. For the Poisson moving average and the Sine wave, the background signals are identical between the sensors. 

### Anomaly types
Anomalies can be introduced individually or in combination:
- **Delay/attenuation** — models exponential moving average sensor response.
- **Noise and constant bias** — configurable per sensor, with optional correlation between noise terms.
- **Spikes** — short-duration deviations, correlated or uncorrelated between sensors, with random sign and magnitude.
- **Drifts** — gradual deviations over time, with configurable slope and duration.

Anomalies are inserted at random positions while ensuring spacing from time-series edges to avoid boundary artifacts.

### Output
The output is a **CSV file** containing:
- Time series for both sensors.
- Flags for each time step indicating anomaly type.
- True error magnitude for each sensor.

## Reproducibility
All random processes are controlled via a user-specified random seed. Full mathematical details of signal generation and anomaly injection are provided in the software documentation and supplementary materials (https://github.com/AstridMarie2/synthsensor --> *Synthetic Sensor Data Generation Framework - Mathematics*). 

All functionality is covered by automated tests (testthat) and continuous integration (GitHub Actions).

  drift_slope      = c(0.05, 0.08),
