Description: Provides functions to generate synthetic time series from two 
    redundant or correlated sensors, with configurable background signals, 
    sensor delay/attenuation, correlated or uncorrelated noise, and anomalies 
    including spikes and drifts. Each output dataset includes per-timestep 
    anomaly flags and true error magnitudes, suitable for developing and 
    benchmarking sensor diagnostic and uncertainty methods. An interactive 
    Shiny app is also provided for visual exploration and CSV export.
