abstract: >
  Provides functions to generate synthetic time series from two redundant or
  correlated sensors, with configurable background signals (AR(1), random walk,
  Poisson moving average, sine), sensor delay/attenuation, correlated or
  uncorrelated noise, and anomalies including spikes and drifts. Outputs include
  per-timestep anomaly flags and true error proxies. Includes an interactive
  Shiny app for exploration and CSV export.
